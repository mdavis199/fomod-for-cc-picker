# Fomod configs

These are modifications for the the excellent utility Skyrim AE mod [Anniversary Edition Content Picker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58890?tab=posts) by [DarkFox127](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4672007).

## Preselect Options

This FOMOD config offers to preselect all options or no options. 

## Cleaned Content

Modifies DarkFox's FOMOD to keep cleaned content in a second mod.    It installs cleaned plugins only for CC content that is already installed.  

You can either install the original and cleaned content as separate mods in MO2 or you can merge the cleaned content after installing the mod you created from DarkFox's.
